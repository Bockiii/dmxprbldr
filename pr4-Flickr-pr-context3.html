March is Women%u2019s History Month. For us, that means that it%u2019s a time for us to stop and say thank you to the women that help make Flickr a vibrant community. Thank you for sharing your photography here, for telling your stories here, and for inspiring others to do the same.

In honor of Women%u2019s History Month and International Women%u2019s Day, we%u2019re asking women photographers of all ages and experience levels, from all countries and backgrounds, to stop by and say hello in the comments below. 

Shout out your work, tell us what brought you to Flickr, or just say hello. From this exchange, we hope that everyone will find new voices and photographers to follow on Flickr. 

This month%u2019s Explore takeover will also focus on the women who help make Flickr what it is. Please comment below if you'd like to be part of this celebration!

Years ago, we invited women to share on Flickr using the tag &quot;ThroughHerLens.&quot; We invite you to continue using this tag on your work not just this month, but throughout the year. And we will work on sharing more and more of your stories and photography.</p></div>
