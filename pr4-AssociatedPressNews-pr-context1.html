	<div class="content"><p>BRUSSELS (AP) — President Joe Biden and Western allies pledged new sanctions and humanitarian aid on Thursday in response to Vladimir <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-nato-5af548b472ba5a3ea4c64d4ef0aa4234">Putin’s assault on Ukraine</a>, but their offers fell short of the more robust military assistance that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded for in a pair of live-video appearances.</p><p>Biden also announced the U.S. would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-biden-united-states-europe-southeast-asia-f0fc4c40066332332f16ad8efd1b02bb">welcome up to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees</a> — though he said many probably prefer to stay closer to home — and provide an additional $1 billion in food, medicine, water and other supplies.</p><p>The Western leaders spent Thursday crafting next steps to counter Russia’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-kyiv-nato-g-7-summit-a25f50750c18ccdaa2ef9b8184142e2b">month-old invasion</a> — and huddling over how they might respond should Putin deploy chemical, biological or even a nuclear weapon. They met in a trio of emergency summits that had them shuttling across Brussels for back-to-back-to-back meetings of NATO, the Group of Seven industrialized nations and the 27-member European Council.</p><div id='afs:Card:709229193465' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Biden, in an early evening news conference after the meetings, warned that a chemical attack by Russia “would trigger a response in kind." </p><p>“You’re asking whether NATO would cross. We’d make that decision at the time,” Biden said.</p><p>However, a White House official said later that did not imply any shift in the U.S. position against direct military action in Ukraine. Biden and NATO allies have stressed that the U.S. and NATO would not put troops on the ground in Ukraine. </p><p>The official was not authorized to comment publicly by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity.</p><p>Zelenskyy, while thankful for the newly promised help, made clear to the Western allies he needed far more than they're currently willing to give.</p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2-cZni3slI" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><p>“One percent of all your planes, one percent of all your tanks,” Zelenskyy asked members of the NATO alliance. “We can’t just buy those. When we will have all this, it will give us, just like you, 100% security.”</p><p>Biden said more aid was on its way. But the Western leaders were treading carefully so as not to further escalate the conflict beyond the borders of Ukraine.</p><p>“NATO has made a choice to support Ukraine in this war without going to war with Russia," said French President Emmanuel Macron. "Therefore we have decided to intensify our ongoing work to prevent any escalation and to get organized in case there is an escalation.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Billions of dollars of military hardware have already been provided. A U.S. official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Western nations were discussing the possibility of providing anti-ship weapons amid concerns that Russia will launch amphibious assaults along the Black Sea coast.</p><p>Biden said his top priority at Thursday's meetings was to make certain that the West stayed on the same page in its response to Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p><p>"The single most important thing is for us to stay unified," he said.</p><p>Finland announced Thursday it would send more military equipment to Ukraine, its second shipment in about three weeks. And Belgium announced it will add one billion euros to its defense budget in response to Russia’s invasion..</p><p>At the same time, Washington will expand its sanctions on Russia, targeting members of the country’s parliament along with defense contractors. The U.S. said it will also work with other Western nations to ensure gold reserves held by Russia's central bank are subject to existing sanctions. </p><p>With Russia facing increasing international isolation, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also warned China against coming to Moscow's rescue. He called on Beijing “to join the rest of the world and clearly condemn the brutal war against Ukraine and not support Russia.”</p><p>But Stoltenberg, too, made clear that the West had a "responsibility to prevent this conflict from becoming a full-fledged war in Europe.”</p><p>The possibility that Russia will use chemical or even nuclear weapons has been a grim topic of conversation in Brussels.</p><p>Stoltenberg said that NATO leaders agreed Thursday to send equipment to Ukraine to help protect it against a chemical weapons attack.</p><p>“This could include detection equipment, protection and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management,” he said.</p><p>White House officials said that both the U.S. and NATO have been working on contingency planning should Russia deploy nonconventional weaponry. NATO has specially trained and equipped forces ready to be deployed if there should be such an attack against a member nation's population, territory or forces. </p><p>The White House National Security Council launched efforts days after the invasion through its “Tiger Team,” which is tasked with planning three months out, and a second strategy group working on a longer term review of any geopolitical shift that may come, according to a senior administration official. The official was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p><p>Both teams are conducting contingency planning for scenarios including Russia’s potential use of chemical or biological weapons, targeting of U.S. security convoys in the region, disruptions to global food supply chains and the growing refugee crisis.</p><p>Biden before departing for Europe on Wednesday said that the possibility of a chemical attack was a “real threat.” In addition, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN this week that Russia could consider using its nuclear weapons if it felt there were “an existential threat for our country.” </p><p>Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin on Thursday warned, “Russia is capable of anything.” </p><p>"They don’t respect any rules,” Marin told reporters. “They don’t respect any international laws that they are actually committed to.”</p><p>The Russian invasion has spurred European nations to reconsider their military spending, and Stoltenberg opened the NATO summit by saying the alliance must “respond to a new security reality in Europe.”</p><p>The bolstering of forces along NATO's eastern flank will put pressure on national budgets.</p><p>The energy crisis exacerbated by the war is a particularly hot topic for the European Council summit, where leaders from Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece are hoping for an urgent, coordinated bloc-wide response. EU officials have said they will seek U.S. help on a plan to top up natural gas storage facilities for next winter, and they also want the bloc to jointly purchase gas.</p><p>German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has dismissed calls to boycott Russian energy supplies, saying it would cause significant damage to his country's economy. Scholz is facing pressure from environmental activists to quickly wean Germany off Russian energy, but he said the process will have to be gradual.</p><p>“To do so from one day to the next would mean plunging our country and all of Europe into recession," Scholz said Wednesday.</p><p>Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Union’s executive arm, said before Biden’s visit that she wanted to discuss the possibility of securing extra deliveries of liquefied natural gas from the United States for the 27-nation bloc “for the next two winters.”</p><p>The EU imports 90% of the natural gas used to generate electricity, heat homes and supply industry, with Russia supplying almost 40% of EU gas and a quarter of its oil. The bloc is hoping to reduce its dependence on Russian gas by diversifying suppliers.</p><p>The U.S. is looking for ways to “surge” LNG supplies to Europe to help, said Jake Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser. </p><p>Poland and other eastern flank NATO countries will also be seeking clarity on how the U.S. and fellow European nations can assist in dealing with their growing concerns about Russian aggression as well as the refugee crisis. More than 3.5 million refugees have fled Ukraine in recent weeks, including more than 2 million to Poland.</p><p>Biden is to visit Poland on Friday, where the energy and refugee issues are expected to be at the center of talks with President Andrzej Duda. </p><p>Four new NATO battlegroups, which usually number between 1,000-1,500 troops, are being set up in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.</p><p>___</p><p>Madhani reported from Washington.

	<div class="content"><p>KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine accused Moscow on Thursday of forcibly taking hundreds of thousands of civilians from shattered Ukrainian cities to Russia, where some may be used as “hostages” to pressure Kyiv to give up.</p><p>Lyudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudsperson, said 402,000 people, including 84,000 children, have been taken against their will.</p><p>The Kremlin gave nearly identical numbers for those who have been relocated, but said they wanted to go to Russia. Ukraine's rebel-controlled eastern regions are predominantly Russian-speaking, and many people there have supported close ties to Moscow.</p><p>A month into the invasion, meanwhile, the two sides traded heavy blows in what has become a devastating war of attrition. Ukraine’s navy said it sank a large Russian landing ship near the port city of Berdyansk that had been used to bring in armored vehicles. Russia claimed to have taken the eastern town of Izyum after fierce fighting.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>At an emergency NATO summit in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleaded with the Western allies via video for planes, tanks, rockets, air defense systems and other weapons, saying his country is “defending our common values.” </p><div id='afs:Card:709229193465' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>U.S President Joe Biden, in Europe for the summit and other high-level meetings, gave assurances more <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-biden-business-g-7-summit-9f6705e72533496f513c3540881d348e">aid is on its way, </a> though it appeared unlikely the West would give Zelenskyy everything he wanted, for fear of triggering a much wider war.</p><p>Around the capital, Kyiv, and other areas, Ukrainian defenders have fought Moscow's ground troops to a near-stalemate, raising fears that a frustrated Russian President Vladimir Putin will resort to chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.</p><p>In other developments Thursday:</p><p>—Ukraine and Russia exchanged a total of 50 military and civilian prisoners, the largest swap reported yet, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said.</p><p>—The pro-Moscow leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, warned that Poland’s proposal to deploy a Western peacekeeping force in Ukraine “will mean World War III.”</p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XrI7KiVMAGo" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><p>—In Chernihiv, where an airstrike this week destroyed a crucial bridge, a city official, Olexander Lomako, said a “humanitarian catastrophe” is unfolding as Russian forces target food storage places. He said about 130,000 people are left in the besieged city, about half its prewar population.</p><p>—Russia said it will offer safe passage starting Friday to 67 ships from 15 foreign countries that are stranded in Ukrainian ports because of the danger of shelling and mines.</p><p>Kyiv and Moscow gave conflicting accounts, meanwhile, about the people being relocated to Russia and whether they were going willingly — as Russia claimed — or were being coerced or lied to.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the roughly 400,000 people evacuated to Russia since the start of the military action were from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Moscow separatists have been fighting for control for nearly eight years.</p><p>Russian authorities said they are providing accommodations and dispensing payments to the evacuees.</p><p>But Donetsk Region Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said that “people are being forcibly moved into the territory of the aggressor state.” Denisova said those removed by Russian troops included a 92-year-old woman in Mariupol who was forced to go to Taganrog in southern Russia.</p><p>Ukrainian officials said that the Russians are taking people's passports and moving them to “filtration camps” in Ukraine’s separatist-controlled east before sending them to various distant, economically depressed areas in Russia. </p><p>Among those taken, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry charged, were 6,000 residents of Mariupol, the devastated port city in the country's east. Moscow's troops are confiscating identity documents from an additional 15,000 people in a section of Mariupol under Russian control, the ministry said. </p><p>Some could be sent as far as the Pacific island of Sakhalin, Ukrainian intelligence said, and are being offered jobs on condition they don’t leave for two years. The ministry said the Russians intend to "use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine.”</p><p>Kyrylenko said that Mariupol’s residents have been long deprived of information and that the Russians feed them false claims about Ukraine’s defeats to persuade them to move to Russia. </p><p>“Russian lies may influence those who have been under the siege,” he said.</p><p>As for the naval attack in Berdyansk, Ukraine claimed two more ships were damaged and a 3,000-ton fuel tank was destroyed when the Orsk was sunk, causing a fire that spread to ammunition supplies. </p><p>Sending a signal that Western sanctions have not brought it to its knees, Russia reopened its stock market but allowed only limited trading to prevent mass sell-offs. Foreigners were barred from selling, and traders were prohibited from short selling, or betting prices would fall.</p><p>Millions of people in Ukraine have made their way out of the country, some pushed to the limit after trying to stay and cope. </p><p>At the central station in the western city of Lviv, a teenage girl stood in the doorway of a waiting train, a white pet rabbit shivering in her arms. She was on her way to join her mother and then go on to Poland or Germany. She had been traveling alone, leaving other family members behind in Dnipro. </p><p>“At the beginning I didn’t want to leave,” she said. “Now I’m scared for my life.”</p><p>___</p><p>Anna reported from Lviv, Ukraine.

The boat will also be returned via Turkey, she said.</p><p>There have previously been reports of local prisoner exchanges on a smaller scale than those announced by Vereshchuk. They included a swap of nine Russian soldiers for a captured Ukrainian mayor. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Wednesday two prisoner swaps had taken place but didn’t provide details of when they happened or who was involved. </p><p>___</p><p>LVIV, Ukraine — Ukraine says more than 400,000 of its citizens have been forcibly taken to Russia.</p><p>Ukrainian Ombudsman Lyudmyla Denisova said at a briefing Thursday that the Ukrainians were taken to by Russian troops from Mariupol and other besieged Ukrainian cities. The number includes 84,000 children. She says they are held in primitive conditions with little food and water.</p><p>Donetsk Region Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko also said that Russians are taking Ukrainians’ passports and take them to filtration camps place where Russian FSB counterintelligence agency officers conduct security checks before moving them to various distant areas in Russia.</p><p>Kyrylenko said that Mariupol’s residents had been long deprived of information and the Russians feed them false claims about Ukraine’s defeats to persuade them to move to Russia. “Russian lies may influence those who have been under the siege,” he said.</p><p>Russian officials reported Wednesday that over 384,000 Ukrainians had voluntarily traveled to Russia where they were being offered accommodation and payments.</p><p>___</p><p>BERLIN — Germany’s foreign minister says Europe needs to beware of Russian efforts to destabilize the Western Balkans against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Berlin on Thursday that such moves preceded Russia’s military engagement in Ukraine, despite Moscow’s continued denial that it was preparing an attack.</p><p>Similar support by Russia for breakaway movements in Bosnia, for example, could endanger the integrity and sovereignty of Western Balkans nations, Baerbock said after a meeting with her Croatian counterpart, Goran Grlic Radman.</p><p>Baerbock said the European Union and its partners would do what they can to help countries now taking in large numbers of Ukrainians fleeing the war, particularly tiny Moldova, which has received the highest number of refugees per capita so far.</p><p>Germany has organized a first direct flight to bring refugees from Moldova to Frankfurt on Friday, with more to follow, she said.</p><p>___</p><p>UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. General Assembly has overwhelmingly approved a resolution blaming Russia for humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and urging an immediate cease-fire and protection for millions of civilians and the homes, schools and hospitals critical to their survival.</p><p>Thursday’s vote on the resolution was 140-5 with only Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea joining Russia in opposing the measure. There were 38 abstentions, including China.</p><p>The resolution deplores Russia’s shelling, airstrikes and “besiegement” of densely populated cities, including the southern city of Mariupol, and demands unhindered access for humanitarian aid.</p><p>The vote was almost exactly the same as on the March 2 resolution the assembly adopted demanding an immediate Russian cease-fire and withdrawal of all its forces and demanding protection for all civilians and infrastructure indispensable to their survival. That vote was 141-5 with 35 abstentions.</p><p>When the result of the vote was announced, many diplomats in the General Assembly chamber burst into applause.</p><p>___</p><p>SOFIA, Bulgaria - Bulgaria’s prime minister said Thursday that his country will recall its ambassador to Moscow for consultations in response to a succession of statements by Russia’s ambassador that have deeply offended Bulgaria’s government.</p><p>Prime Minister Kiril Petkov said the move comes on the heels of ”undiplomatic, sharp and rude” statements made by Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova.</p><p>The latest was on Monday, when Mitrofanova said in an interview with Russia 24 TV channel that “the people of Bulgaria do not support the rhetoric and actions of their government regarding Russia’s special operation in Ukraine.”</p><p>“This is why we will summon our ambassador from Russia for consultations. Usually, when a country summons its ambassador for consultations, the other country should follow suit and do the same,” Petkov said.</p><p>___</p><p>BRUSSELS — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg says the military alliance is stepping up its defenses against chemical and nuclear weapons as concern mounts that Russia might use such weapons in Ukraine.</p><p>Stoltenberg says that NATO leaders agreed at their summit Thursday to send equipment to Ukraine to help protect it against a chemical weapons attack.</p><p>“This could include detection equipment, protection, and medical support, as well as training for decontamination and crisis management,” he told reporters after meeting in Brussels.</p><p>But Stoltenberg says the 30 NATO allies are boosting their own “preparedness and readiness.”</p><p>The leaders agreed Thursday to deploy four new battlegroups, which usually number from 1,000-1,500 troops, to Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. Four other battlegroups are stationed in the Baltic States and Poland.</p><p>NATO nations are concerned that Russia’s attempt to falsely accuse them of working on chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine is part of a ruse by Moscow to create a pretext for using such arms itself.</p><p>___</p><p>LONDON — Britain is sanctioning 65 more companies and individuals over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The targets include Russia’s largest private bank and a woman the British government said was the stepdaughter of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.</p><p>U.K. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the new round of sanctions target strategic industries, banks and business elites. Among those sanctioned are Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private bank and Alrosa, the world’s largest diamond mining company.</p><p>The U.K. also targeted billionaires Eugene Markovich Shvidler, who has close ties to Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich and Herman Gref, the chief executive of Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank. Polina Kovaleva, who was described as Lavrov’s stepdaughter, was also sanctioned as the U.K. broadens the scope of its sanctions to reach people linked to those responsible for “Russian aggression.”</p><p>___</p><p>LVIV, Ukraine -- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry says Russia is making arrangements to forcibly relocate thousands of civilians to Russia from the besieged port of Mariupol.</p><p>It said Thursday Russian forces had taken 6,000 Mariupol residents “to Russian filtration camps in order to use them as hostages and put more political pressure on Ukraine.”</p><p>The Foreign Ministry expressed concern for 15,000 people from a district of Mariupol under Russian control, saying Russian troops were confiscating their identity documents and insisting they traveled to Russia. Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russian troops of obstructing attempts to evacuate civilians from Mariupol, including by seizing bus drivers sent to collect civilians.</p><p>Ukrainian military intelligence said Thursday that Ukrainian civilians were being sent through a “filtration camp” in Russian-controlled territory then onward through southern regions of Russia and then to “economically depressed” parts of the country.</p><p>Some could be sent as far as the Pacific Ocean island of Sakhalin, Ukrainian intelligence said, and are offered jobs on condition they don’t leave for two years. The claims could not be independently verified.</p><p>Russia has said it is helping civilians evacuate from Mariupol and other cities affected by fighting. Russia claims many civilians are keen to find refuge in Russia.</p><p>___</p><p>BRUSSELS — NATO leaders are extending the mandate of Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg for an extra year to help steer the 30-nation military organization through the security crisis sparked by Russia’s war on Ukraine.</p><p>Stoltenberg tweeted Thursday that he is “honored” by the decision of NATO leaders to extend his term until 30 September 2023.</p><p>“As we face the biggest security crisis in a generation, we stand united to keep our Alliance strong and our people safe,” he said.</p><p>The former Norwegian prime minister was named to NATO’s top civilian post in October 2014. It’s the second time that his term of office has been extended. His mandate was due to expire in September.</p><p>___</p><p>BRUSSELS — Group of Seven leaders have announced they are restricting the Russian Central Bank’s use of gold in transactions, while the U.S. announced a new round of sanctions targeting more than 400 elites and members of the Russian State Duma.</p><p>Previously, sanctions against Russian elites, the country’s Central Bank and President Vladimir Putin did not impact Russia’s gold stockpile, which Putin has been accumulating for several years. Russia holds roughly $130 billion in gold reserves, and the Bank of Russia announced Feb. 28 that it would resume the purchase of gold on the domestic precious metals market.</p><p>White House officials said Thursday the move will further blunt Russia’s ability to use its international reserves to prop up Russia’s economy and fund its war against Ukraine.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration announced more sanctions targeting 48 state-owned defense companies, 328 members of the Duma, Russia’s lower parliament, and dozens of Russian elites. The Duma as an entity was also named in the new sanctions.</p><p>The G-7 and the European Union also announced a new effort to share information and coordinate responses to prevent Russia from evading the impact of sanctions that western nations have levied since the Feb. 24 invasion.</p></div>

	<div class="content"><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The historic Senate hearings for <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ketanji-brown-jackson">Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</a>, the first Black woman nominated for the <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court">Supreme Court</a>, have been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-us-supreme-court-new-jersey-cory-booker-436fd1579fe534054be49666dc6bd61a">joyful</a>, combative and clarifying, putting on display the breadth of the nation's partisan divide and the unresolved problems of its past. </p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-stephen-breyer-us-supreme-court-judiciary-race-and-ethnicity-0a073c5bf366bdc2e101becdae602bc3">fourth and final day </a> of the Senate Judiciary Committee's consideration of Jackson wrapped up Thursday with several hours of testimony from outside experts.</p><p>The American Bar Association's standing committee on the federal judiciary has afforded its highest rating, “well qualified,” to the Harvard-educated Jackson. A junior high school friend gushed over the “supernova" debate team champion. Skeptics, including the Alabama's attorney general, warned that her views on crime and policing are “outside the mainstream.”</p><div id='afs:Card:462681408592' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (2022Midtermelections) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Yet in the 50-50 Senate, where a Trump-era rules change means it is no longer necessary to muster broad support to confirm Supreme Court nominees, the hearings have become less about the vote ahead and more about framing the politics of the eventual outcome. </p><p>Democrats are on track to confirm President Joe Biden's pick, with a vote expected by time senators leave for a scheduled spring recess April 8.</p><p>Some takeaways from Day Four of the weeklong hearing:</p><p>REVIEWING THE RECORD</p><p>“Outstanding, excellent, superior, superb.” </p><p>The ABA committee gave Jackson the same highest rating that has been bestowed on most recent Supreme Court nominees, with the exception of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/amy-coney-barrett">Justice Amy Coney Barrett</a>.</p><p>The committee's chair, Ann Claire Williams, testified on the review of some 250-legal professionals on Jackson’s record. Asked how Jackson’s integrity was viewed, Williams said: “Those are the comments.”</p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gi1KRIUF5I0" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><p>Republican senators are focusing on a narrow slice of the judge's work, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-us-supreme-court-ap-fact-check-child-pornography-josh-hawley-68d5a59edf46ea3f28e35cf32f84fe19">the child pornography cases </a> that Jackson herself has said are among “the most difficult” of her career — some of which still give her nightmares. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Much the way senators opposed to the first Black nominee to the court, <a href="ttps://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-jackson-crime-e20eb531b5ff3d17544a79d7db33cafd">Thurgood Marshall,</a> a half-century ago portrayed the storied civil rights lawyer as soft on crime in his work defending Black people, Republicans have spotlighted Jackson's sentencings in criminal cases, they show too much “empathy” for defendants.</p><p>A witness for the Republican side, Attorney General Steven T. Marshall of Alabama, said he believes Jackson shows more deference to criminals appearing in her courtroom than she does victims. He said her views of law enforcement reforms are “outside the mainstream.”</p><p>Republicans are trying to link Jackson to the left-leaning “defund the police” movements, but it's unclear if the approach is working. The judge has backing from the nation's largest law enforcement organization, the Fraternal Order of Police, and she has spoken emotionally about her brother and uncle who worked as police officers.</p><p>___</p><p>TRUMP'S INFLUENCE HOVERS</p><p>Donald Trump is gone from the White House, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-alabama-donald-trump-elections-mo-brooks-a201850587a5fc0ea00eeabf866c51f2">his influence over Republicans</a> endures.</p><p>One witness called by Republicans was Alessandra Serano, the chief legal officer of Operation Underground Railroad, a Utah based anti-trafficking nonprofit group. It is under criminal investigation in the state for exaggerating its role in law enforcement arrests involving child predators, in order to fundraise.</p><p>The organization has become popular online and found success raising money off of conspiracy theories that have are popular among suburban mothers and groups that arose out of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-donald-trump-joe-biden-violence-religion-33093d606470be4bc0cd8df6a474a097">QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, which casts Trump as a hero fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals operating a child sex trafficking ring. </p><p>As Republicans focus on Jackson's rulings in the child pornography cases, they are tapping into this strain of the GOP and its popularity among backers of the former president, drumming up voter interest before the November elections that will determine control of Congress.</p><p>From retirement in Florida, Trump has insisted, falsely, that he won the 2020 election, a belief shared by many Republicans, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f">despite dozens of court cases and independent reviews that have rejected GOP claims of a rigged election</a>. Trump is considering another run for president in 2024.</p><p>At one point Thursday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., tried to air some of these points. He asked Alabama's Marshall whether Biden was the “duly elected president” of the United States.</p><p>Marshall replied that Biden was the president.</p><p>Pressed if the witness was purposefully omitting the words “duly elected,” Marshall simply reiterated: "I’m answering the question. He is the president of the United States." </p><p>Alabama, with Marshall, was among other states joining in a lawsuit challenging the results of the 2020 election. </p><p>___</p><p>THE NEXT CIVIL RIGHTS ERA</p><p>The Senate hearings have been filled each day with some of the leading civil rights leaders celebrating, as Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-hearing-day-3-highlights-95aea2b41a957788f3dd072fb1e396f2">the “joy”</a> of reaching this milestone in American history.</p><p>Testifying Thursday, the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Joyce Beatty, said Booker “spoke not only to Black America, but to America.”</p><p>Beatty, D-Ohio, put Jackson's moment alongside those of civil rights icon Rosa Parks and other Americans and urged senators to consider what the judge's confirmation to the high court would mean for the country.</p><p>“We are no longer looking at 50-65 years ago,” she said, of the past era of civil rights battles, “but yet we’re still fighting.”</p><p>___</p><p>COUNTING THE VOTES</p><p>Senators no longer need bipartisan cooperation to confirm judicial nominees, after rules changes that allow a simple 51-vote majority for the lifetime appointment to the court. </p><p>With Jackson's nomination almost assured by Democrats, who hold a slim majority in the 50-50 chamber with Vice President Kamala Harris able to break a tie, Republicans unable to stop the judge's confirmation at least want sow doubt in the outcome.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/josh-hawley">Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, </a><a href="https://apnews.com/hub/ted-cruz">Ted Cruz of Texas </a> and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee have led the charge, quizzing the federal judge about her views on issues of race and crime, amplifying election-year grievances and a backlash over changing culture.</p><p>Jackson is the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-stephen-breyer-joe-biden-us-supreme-court-thurgood-marshall-0b73ca8ac79cb133dd84570b389301d7"> first federal public defender</a> to be nominated to the Supreme Court and her efforts representing those accused of crimes, alongside <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-notable-opinions-a764d001648c5151eb48e7f5663c403e">her work as a federal judge</a>, have provided a lengthy record of difficult cases for senators to review.</p><p>Jackson has presented herself a judge who relies on method, not judicial philosophy, to remain neutral as she works to “stay in my lane.”</p><p>If confirmed, Jackson would also become the sixth female justice in the court's history and the fourth among the nine members of the current court.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Colleen Long and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.</p></div>

	<time datetime="2022-03-24 18:17:46">2022-03-24 18:17:46</time>
	<br /><p class="author">by: JONATHAN J. COOPER</p>
	<div class="content"><p>PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona Legislature passed bills Thursday to prohibit gender reassignment surgery for minors and ban transgender athletes from playing on girls sports teams, joining a growing list of Republican-controlled states attempting to restrict transgender rights as they gain more visibility in culture and society.</p><p>Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has not said whether he will sign either bill. Two GOP governors this week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-sports-florida-utah-cultures-2864995ce9b2c473fc1dc7bcff8a56dc"> bucked conservatives in their party and vetoed bills</a> in Indiana and Utah requiring trans girls to play on boys sports teams.</p><p>Republicans have said blocking transgender athletes from girls sports teams would protect the integrity of women’s sports, claiming that trans athletes would have an advantage. </p><p>Many point to the transgender collegiate swimmer Lia Thomas, who won an individual title at the NCAA Women’s Division I Swimming and Diving Championship last week.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>But there are few trans athletes in Arizona schools. Since 2017, about 16 trans athletes have received waivers to play on teams that align with their gender identities out of about 170,000 high school athletes in the state, according to the Arizona Interscholastic Association.</p><div id='afs:Card:326333309451' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (apf-sports) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“This bill to me is all about biology,” said Republican Rep. Shawnna Bolick, who said she played on a coed team in the 1980s but could not have made the high school boys team. “In my opinion, its unfair to allow biological males to compete with biological girls sports.”</p><p>Critics said the legislation dehumanizes trans youth to address an issue that hasn’t been a problem.</p><p>“We’re talking about legislating bullying against children who are already struggling just to get by,” said Democratic Rep. Kelli Butler, fighting back tears.</p><p>Until two years ago, no state had passed a law regulating gender-designated youth sports. But the issue has become front and center in Republican-led statehouses since Idaho lawmakers passed the nation’s first sports participation law in 2020. That law is now blocked in court, along with another in West Virginia.</p><p>“This bill is creating a pointless and harmful solution to a non-existent issue,” Skyler Morrison, a 13-year-old transgender girl, told lawmakers during a committee hearing earlier this month. “It’s obvious this bill is just an excuse to discriminate against transgender girls.”</p><p>Republicans around the country have leaned into culture war issues including transgender rights. The debate and vote on the transgender sports legislation came the same morning the Arizona House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-us-supreme-court-health-arizona-mississippi-d88d5a28973039a3fedadaaf3d086b1c">passed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy</a>. Republicans said little during debates on all three bills.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Arizona is one of 20 states that have considered legislation to restrict gender-affirming health care. The bill originally would have banned all such care for minors but was scaled back to restrict only irreversible procedures, such as surgeries related to gender reassignment.</p><p>Similar legislation passed the Idaho House earlier this month but it died in the Senate amid concerns from some Republicans about restricting parental rights.</p><p>Supporters of the Arizona bill said it would prevent children from making permanent decisions that they might later come to regret. Republican Rep. John Kavanagh compared the vote to the Legislature’s unanimous decision in 2014 to ban genital mutilation.</p><p>“We should stand the same way today because this is mutilation of children,” Kavanagh said. “It is irreversible. It is horrific.”</p><p>Critics said the decision should be left to parents, their children and the health care team caring for them. They said surgeries are only performed after extensive care and therapy.</p><p>“We’re talking about our kids, who are already going to be taking the proper steps with their parents to be able to be who they are,” said Democratic Rep. Andres Cano.</p></div>

	<time datetime="2022-03-24 18:02:34">2022-03-24 18:02:34</time>

	<div class="content"><p>The last full working day of Bill Clinton’s presidency ended with a dreary Washington winter afternoon. Wind-swept rain and sleet pounded on the windows of <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/madeleine-albright">Madeleine Albright’s</a> seventh-floor office at the State Department, obscuring her usually clear view of the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>Next door, in the office of her chief of staff, Albright had joined a small group to commemorate the end of her term as America’s first female secretary of state and her time as the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government.</p><p>Eyes were only partially on the television in the room that was tuned to a replay of Albright’s final television appearance as a government official: on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” which had been taped several days earlier in Chicago.</p><p>___</p><p>EDITOR'S NOTE — Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright died Wednesday of cancer. AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee knew Albright not only as America’s top diplomat, but also as a professor of his at Georgetown University.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>___</p><p>A bottle of obscure liquor — a gift to her from some foreign leader — was cracked open as stories were told, many about her historic trip to North Korea a few months earlier, some about her epic travel pace, her predilection for exotic shopping, but also the bitter fight over the 2000 presidential election that had just ended in a controversial Supreme Court decision that would bring George W. Bush to the White House in just three days.</p><div id='afs:Card:565904793704' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (MadeleineAlbright) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Albright was a lifelong Democrat who had famously forsworn partisan politics during her four years as America’s top diplomat but had been increasingly frustrated by the nasty tone of the election dispute between Bush and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore. I mentioned that the weather didn't look great for the upcoming inauguration and she looked out the rain-spattered windows and remarked with a wry smile: “I hope it rains on those f - - - - - s’ parade.”</p><p>The remark was jolting because it was so unlike the Albright that I had known. She often said that she had had her “political instincts surgically removed” when she became secretary of state. I had covered her for nearly three years as a State Department reporter for the French news agency AFP, and, while most people including the traveling press corps, knew well her political leanings, she had striven to mask them and was unfailingly polite to Democrats and Republicans alike. </p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhoTfoj1s4A" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>I had certainly never heard her use such coarse language. Not in off-the-record encounters during her frenzied travels to locales that former secretaries of state had never ventured to — Kano in northern Nigeria; Samarkand and Bukhara in Uzbekistan and perhaps most famously Pyongyang, North Korea, to name just a few. And not ever in lectures or other events of hers that I attended a decade earlier at Georgetown University, where she had been a professor of mine at the School of Foreign Service.</p><p>The closest anyone could recall was when she castigated the Cuban government at the United Nations for shooting down a civilian Brothers to the Rescue plane by saying it hadn't been “cojones” but rather “cowardice.” Or her studied and stern visage of annoyance, anger and aggravation when she learned that Clinton had lied when he swore to her that he had not had an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern.</p><p>Her rare political comments were almost always tame in nature. Albright once recalled asking one of her diplomat father's most gifted students at the University of Denver to serve as a foreign policy adviser on a Democratic campaign. “But Madeleine, I'm a Republican,” she said Condoleezza Rice had replied. Four years after Albright left government, Rice became the second female secretary of state and the first Black woman to hold the office.</p><p>Madeleine Albright was a woman of conviction and determination who liked to say she told things like they were and not the way she might like them to be. She often punctuated her otherwise conservative attire with a fancy brooch, often picked to send a message to her interlocutors. They ranged from the mundane to the menacing — including one of a snake.</p><p>Having fled eastern Europe from the horrors of the Nazi era and subsequent Soviet suppression, she abhorred dictators and authoritarianism. And yet, she met with some of the worst. Syria’s Hafez al-Assad, North Korea’s Kim Jong Il, Sierra Leone rebel leader Foday Sankoh and others can all be found in her appointment books. She liked to say that America was “THE indispensable nation” as she lobbied for more support for U.S. diplomacy at home and abroad. </p><p>She believed in the promise of the United States and as the glass-ceiling-breaking first woman to run the State Department tried tirelessly to change the “pale, male, Yale" culture of the foreign service. She championed the creation of a U.S.-led “Community of Democracies” to promote greater global respect for human rights and freedom even when some of America's closest allies, notably France, sneered at the idea.</p><p>Once, in the middle of a Clinton state visit to India, Albright broke off from the trip in Delhi to fly nearly 12 hours to Geneva, Switzerland, with a refueling stop in Crete, to deliver a 15-minute speech excoriating China's human rights record before what was then known as the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Having made her case, she turned around and flew back to India, rejoining the presidential visit in Mumbai.</p><p>Albright drew criticism in left-wing and humanitarian circles for her support of punishing sanctions imposed on Iraq during Saddam Hussein’s rule, telling an interviewer once that the humanitarian suffering that many blamed on the sanctions had been an unfortunate but unavoidable side effect of implementing U.S. policy. "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price — we think the price is worth it,” she said in comments that remain anathema.</p><p>Yet, her active participation in several Mideast peace attempts — both between Israel and the Palestinians at Camp David and between Israel and Syria in Shepherdstown, West Virginia — and her mission to North Korea led others to believe she might be too willing to negotiate.</p><p>From running after Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a Parisian driveway to stop him from walking out of peace talks to listening to Assad rant for hours about Syria’s rightful place in the region and admiring a surreal mass gymnastics performance beside Kim Jong Il in a packed Pyongyang stadium, Albright was never embarrassed or afraid to take diplomacy to the limits.</p><p>None of those efforts would result in success, but Albright was convinced they had value and was determined to keep trying. After the failure of Camp David, for instance, Albright sought until the very end of the Clinton administration to keep Israeli-Palestinian peace talks alive. </p><p>And there was Kosovo. She was such a strong advocate for NATO’s intervention in the conflict, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/madeleine-albright-diplomacy-belgrade-serbia-europe-0f3d82c0417f061f48b092812a1bc609">some called it "Madeleine’s War.”</a></p><p>She was was greeted as a hero by thousands of Kosovars when she visited a refugee camp in neighboring Macedonia during the war.

	<div class="content"><p>MOSTYSKA, Ukraine (AP) — Russia’s invasion has displaced half of Ukraine’s children. On a hospital bed in a town close to the border with Poland, a little girl with a long blonde braid and dressed in pink is one of them.</p><p>To get there, Zlata Moiseinko survived a chronic heart condition, daily bombings, days of sheltering in a damp and chilly basement and nights of sleeping in a freezing car. The fragile 10-year-old became so unsettled that her father risked his life to return to their ninth-floor apartment 60 miles (90 kilometers) south of the capital, Kyiv, to rescue her pet hamster, Lola, to comfort her.</p><p>The animal now rests in a small cage beside Zlata’s bed in a schoolhouse that has been converted into a field hospital operated by Israeli medical workers. The girl and her family hope to join friends in Germany if they can arrange the paperwork that allows her father to cross the border with them.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“I want peace for all Ukraine,” the little girl said, shyly.</p><p>The United Nations children’s agency says half of the country’s children, or 4.3 million of an estimated 7.5 million, have now fled their homes, including about 1.8 million refugees who have left the country.</p><div id='afs:Card:709229193465' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>The children are everywhere, curled up amid suitcases in train stations, humanitarian aid tents, evacuation convoys. It is one of the largest such displacements since World War II.</p><p>Zlata’s mother, Natalia, folded her hands in prayer and was close to tears. Thursday marks a month of war and already she can hardly take any more.</p><p>“I ask for help for our children and the elderly, “ the mother said.</p><p>She recalled the escape from their community of Bila Tserkva that put her daughter’s life in peril beyond the ever-present threat of airstrikes.</p><p>As Russian planes pounded overhead, aiming for the local military base, the family decided to run. They found shelter for a week in a cold, damp basement in a village. The girl’s family struggled to keep her calm and attended, since her heart condition requires constant care.</p><p>“We gave her medication to calm her down,” her mother said. But it was not enough. Every loud sound was jarring. The family had few options, without friends and family to call on for help along the road west towards Poland and safety. Eventually they tried to shelter with an acquaintance of the girl’s grandmother, Nadia, but the sounds of airplanes and air raid sirens followed them.</p><p>On the final drive to the border, Zlata and her family slept in their car in freezing weather. At the border, amid confusion over documents and the girl’s father, they were turned back. Ukraine is not allowing men between 18 and 60 to leave the country in case they’re called to fight, with few exceptions.</p><p>It was by chance that the family heard about the Israeli field hospital in the Ukrainian border town of Mostyska. Now they are regrouping in relative comfort, without the scream of sirens.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>At times, to fill the silence, Zlata plays the piano at the school. She missed playing while the family was on the run, her mother said. She proudly showed off her daughter’s YouTube channel of performances. The most recent video, however, showed their basement hideout instead. As the shaking camera panned to show a bare light bulb and concrete walls, the mother narrated in a whisper.</p><p>“All we have is potatoes and a few blankets,” she said in the recording. “I hope we won’t stay here long.”</p><p>For now, until the family moves again, there is some peace. A drawing by Zlata has been tacked up in the hallway. On a nearby bed, a stuffed panda and a doll have been placed in a toy embrace.</p><p>The girl has been transformed. She arrived at the field hospital severely dehydrated, said one of the Israeli physicians, Dr. Michael Segal, who was born in Kyiv and who has been moved by the stories he hears from back home.</p><p>“It’s very close to my heart,” Segal said of Ukraine. People have lost everything “in one brief moment.”</p><p>Zlata’s family “came here crying, not knowing what to do,” he added.</p><p>The medical staff stepped in and even treated her hamster, her first-ever pet, doctors said.</p><p>And reminded of that, the girl’s exhausted mother smiled.</p><p>“That hamster’s the superstar of the clinic,” she said. “It had been over-stressed, too.”</p></div>

	<div class="content"><p>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — A news presenter on Afghanistan’s TOLO TV wept as he read the announcement. Images of girls crying after being turned back from school flooded social media. Aid groups and many others remained baffled. </p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-education-kabul-taliban-dcdc0ba6768213009f69cc6e284d7f52">The Taliban have so far refused to explain their sudden decision</a> to renege on the pledge to allow girls to go to school beyond sixth grade. Schools were supposed to reopen to older girls on Wednesday, the start of the new school year. </p><p>The ban caught even the Taliban-appointed Education Ministry unprepared. In many places across Afghanistan, some girls in higher grades returned to schools, only to be told to go home. </p><p>The move may have been designed to appease the Taliban’s hard-line base but it came at the expense of further alienating the international community. The world has been reluctant to officially recognize Afghanistan's new rulers, concerned the Taliban would impose similar harsh measures and restrictions — particularly limiting women's rights to education and work — as when they previously ruled the country in the late 1990s. </p><div id='afs:Card:553182830256' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Afghanistan) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>The United Nations children’s agency told The Associated Press on Thursday they were blindsided by the announcement.</p><p>“I think that yesterday was a very confusing day for all of us,” said Jeannette Vogelaar, UNICEF’s chief of education in Afghanistan. </p><p>“We were blindsided," said Sam Mort, UNICEF’s communications chief in Afghanistan. “All the messages, all the actions that had been taking place led us to believe that schools were opening, and as we understand it, that’s what our counterparts in the Ministry of Education believed as well.” </p><p>Ahead of the planned reopening, in remote and deeply conservative villages — where women teachers may not have been available to educate girls — arrangements were made for older male teachers, who were considered acceptable, to step in and teach all-girls classes beyond sixth grade. </p><p>Coincidentally or not, the Taliban leadership was summoned on Wednesday to southern Kandahar province amid rumors of a Cabinet shuffle, which was later denied. Still, reports have persisted of declining health of the elderly, Taliban-appointed Prime Minister Hasan Akhund, a hard-liner.</p><p>Since the Taliban seized power in mid-August during the last weeks of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces from Afghanistan, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-afghanistan-kabul-taliban-abdul-ghani-baradar-56455c9c2e145c3e5bf57d697d968834">there have been reports of divisions among Taliban leaders, with lines drawn between the hard-liners and pragmatists.</a></p><p>It's unclear whether a tussle among the Taliban on how to rule the country could have contributed to Wednesday's ban but Torek Farhadi, an analyst who has advised past Afghan governments, called it a misfire.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“They really messed up by not keeping their word,” he said of the Taliban.</p><p>Afghanistan's PenPath Volunteers, a group that works to promote education programs for all in rural areas, is planning to launch demonstrations against the Taliban ban, said Matiullah Wesa, the organization's founder.</p><p>Started in 2009 by two brothers from the Taliban heartland of southern Kandahar, the organization has secret schools and thousands of volunteers distributing schools supplies across the country. </p><p>In Kabul on Wednesday, sisters Raihana Mirzakhail, 18, and Suria Mirzakhail, 17, showed up at their Mawlana Jalaluddin Mohammad Balkhi school.

	<div class="content"><p>NEW DELHI (AP) — The company behind a COVID-19 vaccine touted as a key tool for the developing world has sent tens of millions of doses to wealthy nations but provided none yet to the U.N.-backed effort to supply poorer countries, a sign that inequity persists in the global response to the pandemic.</p><p>A quarter-million doses from the company were supposed to be available to the vaccine-sharing initiative, called COVAX, by March. But the U.N. agency in charge of deliveries says the first shipments now likely won't be made until April or May. </p><p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. The company, Novavax, got $388 million from one of the organizations leading COVAX to fast-track the vaccine's development and help make the shot available in poorer countries. </p><p>The investment guaranteed COVAX the “right of first refusal” to the first Novavax doses, but the deal applied only to factories in the Czech Republic, South Korea and Spain, said Bjorg Dystvold Nilsson, spokesman for COVAX co-founder CEPI.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>There are other factories that aren't part of the deal — and their shots are going elsewhere.</p><p>The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine maker, has manufactured millions of Novavax doses. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs and the institute, more than 28.9 million of those doses were sent to the Netherlands in January and February, while Australia received about 6 million doses. Indonesia also received about 9 million doses in December. </p><div id='afs:Card:973447302597' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Coronaviruspandemic) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Thousands of other Novavax doses were also shipped from a Netherlands factory to other EU countries.</p><p>“Whatever the reason, a vaccine that was believed to be highly suitable for poor countries is now in large part going to rich countries,” said Zain Rizvi, a drug policy expert at the U.S. advocacy group Public Citizen. “It’s tragic that in year three of the pandemic, we still cannot get the resources, attention and political will to solve vaccine inequity.”</p><p>The delay is the latest setback for COVAX, which has been repeatedly hit by supply problems and has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-business-coronavirus-vaccine-pandemics-5053ab9a4c6288e1b70ccd67aa34c504">missed numerous targets</a> to share doses.</p><p>Last year, WHO’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus decried the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-inequality-dac9c07b324e29d3597037b8dc1d908a">chasm </a> in vaccine supplies between rich and poor countries as a “catastrophic moral failure.”</p><p>Vaccine availability has been improving in poorer regions recently, but logistical problems persist. </p><p>According to data from Oxford University, only about 14% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. More than 680 million doses of COVAX-provided vaccines remain unused or have expired, according to government data. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Even with vaccine supplies improving, some officials were eagerly awaiting the Novavax vaccine in particular because it is easier to transport and store than some other coronavirus shots. They also hoped it might be more enticing to people skeptical of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which suffered through a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84"> botched rollout</a> in Europe.</p><p>Countries including Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic and Kiribati were among those in line to be offered Novavax doses by March from COVAX. </p><p>Before the pandemic, Novavax was a small American company that had never brought any vaccine to market. Its shots have proven highly effective, but it is relying heavily on other companies to make them. </p><p>The company, struggling to scale up production, also has delayed delivery to other countries, including some in the European Union. COVAX is supposed to receive more than 1 billion Novavax doses. </p><p>In a statement, the Gaithersburg, Maryland, company acknowledged that it had yet to share any shots with the vaccines alliance Gavi, which fronts the COVAX effort, but said it stands ready to do so. </p><p>“We continue to work with Gavi to reach our shared goal of ensuring global access to our protein-based vaccine where it is needed most,” Novavax said. </p><p>Gavi suggested part of the delay is that the Novavax vaccine wasn't authorized by WHO until December. Gavi said it planned to allocate Novavax in the future and was “in close touch with the manufacturer and expects the supply to be available for delivery when countries need it.” </p><p>Health officials also worry that the urgency to vaccinate people everywhere against COVID-19 has disappeared — especially as many countries roll back precautions and the world’s attention is diverted.</p><p>“Rich countries have moved on from COVID and everyone is fixated on the war in Ukraine, but COVID-19 remains an acute crisis for most people in the world,” said Ritu Sharma, a vice-president at the charity CARE. </p><p>She said COVAX was still desperately short of vaccines and that based on the current pace of vaccination, the world was still “years and years” away from immunizing enough people to stop future COVID-19 waves.</p><p>Other experts said it was incumbent on public health agencies to ensure their investments into vaccines would benefit poor countries and to be more transparent about what went wrong.</p><p>“Whatever the explanation is, it’s unsatisfactory,” said Brook Baker, an access to medicines specialist at Northeastern University. “The bottom line is that there are still a lot of unvaccinated people in poor countries and once again, they are at the back of the line.”</p><p>___</p><p>Cheng reported from London.

	<div class="content"><p>NEW YORK (AP) — New York City's mayor exempted athletes and performers — including Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving — from the city’s vaccine mandate Thursday, while keeping the rule in place for private and public workers who risk losing their jobs for refusing to get inoculated. </p><p>Several public employee unions whose members were fired for refusing the shots blasted Mayor Eric Adams for apparently lifting the rule only for wealthy and famous athletes. Adams dismissed the criticism, saying exemptions for athletes and performers were important to the city’s economic recovery. </p><p>The exemption is effective immediately. One of the first beneficiaries will be Irving, a vaccine holdout who was allowed to rejoin the Nets in January but only when they played out of town games. The Nets need him as they push for a playoff spot with nine games left in their regular season.</p><p>Adams’ predecessor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, made vaccination mandatory as a workplace safety rule last year before he left office but created a loophole exempting players and performers who aren’t based in New York City. Adams said he felt that was unfair. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><div id='afs:Card:888845693546' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (BrooklynNets) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>“Players attract people to the stadium,” Adams remarked as he announced the change during a news conference at Citi Field, where the Mets play. Accompanying him were Mets President Sandy Alderson and Yankees president Randy Levine, both of whom praised the decision. </p><p>“By putting our home teams on (an) equal playing field, we increase their chances of winning and that has a real impact on our city,” he said. </p><p>Public employees' unions weren't buying that.</p><p>“There can’t be one system for the elite and another for the essential workers of our city," said Harry Nespoli, president of the Municipal Labor Committee, an umbrella group of unions that together represent about 350,000 city workers.</p><p>The city’s largest police union echoed that argument, saying its officers “don’t deserve to be treated like second-class citizens.”</p><p>"If the mandate isn’t necessary for famous people, then it’s not necessary for the cops who are protecting our city in the middle of a crime crisis,” said union president Pat Lynch.</p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmrAipIyocE" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><p>The city last month fired more than 1,400 workers who failed to comply with the vaccine mandate. Adams said Thursday that he had no plans at this time to rehire those workers.</p><p>“This exemption sends the wrong message that higher-paid workers and celebrities are being valued as more important than our devoted civil servants, which I reject,” said City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is not related to the mayor.</p><p>Jay Varma, a health adviser to de Blasio, said in a tweet that the former mayor's mandate had legal standing because it applied to everyone.</p><p>“#VaccinesWork … unless you’re rich and powerful, in which case, #LobbyingWorks,” Varma said.

	<div class="content"><p>A second insider in a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told jurors Thursday that the group was prepared to use a grenade launcher and machine gun to fight security officers at her vacation home.</p><p>Kaleb Franks, who <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-crime-michigan-gretchen-whitmer-grand-rapids-fa4c4293c9265a668993fb42a568de2c">pleaded guilty</a> in February, backed up many points offered a day earlier by Ty Garbin, another man who admitted a role in a wild scheme to abduct Whitmer and somehow take her by boat out to Lake Michigan.</p><p>Franks, 27, said an alleged leader, Adam Fox, believed Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions were “tyrannical” and that the U.S. Constitution gave the men a right to strike back. He said no one was forced to stick with the plan and many people had dropped away by late summer 2020.</p><p>“I was going to be an operator,” Franks replied when asked by a prosecutor to describe his role in a kidnapping. “I would be one of the people on the front line, so to speak, using my gun.”</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>He said Fox talked about snatching the governor “every time I saw him.”</p><p>Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-traverse-city-grand-rapids-d84520c39c294c641c00053591da263a">are on trial</a> in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Along with Franks and Garbin, the four were arrested in October 2020, a month before the national election.</p><div id='afs:Card:536584704397' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Whitmerkidnapplottrial) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Garbin, 26, testified Wednesday that Whitmer’s kidnapping could serve as the “ignition” for a U.S. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-traverse-city-grand-rapids-d84520c39c294c641c00053591da263a">civil war involving antigovernment groups and</a> possibly prevent the election of Joe Biden.</p><p>Authorities said the men were armed extremists who, after weeks of training, were trying to come up with $4,000 for an explosive. They practiced that summer by dashing in and out of crude structures built to resemble a house or office.</p><p>Traveling at night, they scouted Whitmer's second home in Elk Rapids in September 2020 and inspected a bridge that could be blown up to frustrate any police response, according to trial testimony and conversations that were secretly recorded.</p><p>Croft “discussed attacking her security detail,” Franks told the jury. “He said he would use the grenade launcher that he had, and he was discussing mounting a machine gun on top of the truck.”</p><p>Franks, a drug rehabilitation coach, said he joined a militia, the Wolverine Watchmen, to work on his gun skills. He eventually met Fox and Croft, who were not members of the militia, and found himself in the middle of a conspiracy.</p><p>Franks said he stuck with the group because he hoped he would be killed in a shootout with police during the kidnapping but kept it from others.</p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“I no longer wanted to live,” he said, moments after settling into the witness chair. “A large portion of my family had died. I was struggling financially. Just wasn't happy."</p><p>Defense attorneys are trying to show the jury that there was no credible plot, just a lot of profane, violent and crazy talk about Whitmer and other politicians trampling their rights during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also claim informants and undercover agents who infiltrated the group entrapped the men.</p><p>During questioning by the defense, Garbin said there was discussion about taking Whitmer by boat to Lake Michigan after kidnapping her, then dumping the motor into the water and leaving her to drift.</p><p>But Garbin also acknowledged that the group didn’t have a boat lined up, and he wasn’t certain how they would get back to shore while the governor floated solo.</p><p>“The purpose of this was to be a massive inconvenience, right? Because she would just get picked up on the lake,” said Croft defense attorney Joshua Blanchard, referring to a rescue.</p><p>“At some point, yes,” Garbin replied. </p><p>Garbin, an airplane mechanic, began <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ty-garbin-plead-guilty-kidnap-whitmer-e75bd5bd6afef044b20efde2559ea855">cooperating with prosecutors</a> soon after the group was arrested. He was rewarded with a relatively light six-year prison sentence, a term that could be reduced after the trial. Franks hasn't been sentenced yet but is also hoping for a break.</p><p>Whitmer, a Democrat, rarely talks publicly about the case, though she referred to “surprises” during her term that seem like “something out of fiction” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-covid-health-covid-19-pandemic-michigan-1e87e8e3c78ae08b4382730fcbd9d63f">when she filed for reelection</a> on March 17.</p><p>She <a href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-donald-trump-kidnapping-health-816581f422e64c8fbb7ca119ed165b6e">has blamed former President Donald Trump</a> for fomenting anger over coronavirus restrictions and refusing to condemn right-wing extremists like those charged in the case.

	<time datetime="2022-03-24 04:04:29">2022-03-24 04:04:29</time>
	<br /><p class="author">by: MARY CLARE JALONICK and KEVIN FREKING</p>
	<div class="content"><p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell announced Thursday that he will vote against confirming Ketanji Brown Jackson, saying he “cannot and will not” support the groundbreaking nominee for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court.</p><p>While McConnell's opposition was not unexpected and Jackson's confirmation is still on track, his declaration coming only hours after the Senate Judiciary Committee wrapped up four days of hearings probably will lead many fellow Republicans to follow suit.</p><p>Democrats can confirm Jackson, the first Black woman nominated for the nation's highest court, without any GOP support in the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris can cast the tiebreaking vote.</p><p>McConnell slammed the liberal groups that have supported Jackson, and he criticized her for refusing to take a position on the size of the nine-member court, even though that decision is ultimately up to Congress. Some advocacy have pushed for enlarging the court after three of President Donald Trump's nominees cemented a conservative majority. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>“Judge Jackson was the court packers’ pick and she testified like it," McConnell, R-Ky. said in a floor speech. </p><div id='afs:Card:874570915921' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (KetanjiBrownJackson) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><p>Over two days of committee questioning this week, Republicans interrogated Jackson about her record as a federal judge, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-us-supreme-court-covid-health-josh-hawley-74cfbd0fd8b5cb54772e6e99d82a1bdf">her sentencing of criminal defendants, </a> as she seeks to become the first Black woman on the nation's highest court.</p><p>Legal experts praised Jackson in the final day of hearings Thursday, with a top lawyers’ group saying its review found she has a “sterling” reputation, “exceptional” competence and is well qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. </p><p>“Outstanding, excellent, superior, superb,” testified Ann Claire Williams, chair of the American Bar Association committee that makes recommendations on federal judges. “Those are the comments from virtually everyone we interviewed.” </p><&zwnj;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i5TokmvldXw" width="560" height="315">
</iframe><p>Williams said the group spoke to more than 250 judges and lawyers about Jackson. “The question we kept asking ourselves: How does one human being do so much so extraordinary well?” </p><p>Democrats are hoping to win bipartisan votes for President Joe Biden's historic nominee, but Republicans have portrayed Jackson as soft on crime in her nine years on the federal bench. Jackson, supported by committee Democrats, pushed back on that GOP narrative in more than 22 hours of questioning, explaining the sentencing process in detail and telling them: “nothing could be further from the truth.” </p><p>The four-hour hearing Thursday featured not only legal experts but government officials and civil rights groups who supported Jackson and conservative advocates who opposed her. </p><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Alabama Attorney General Steven Marshall, a witness invited by the minority, echoed the Republicans' concerns. Marshall said Jackson's supporters cite her as a voice for the vulnerable, but “we should be interested in exploring whether her zeal is equally fervent for another class of our most vulnerable — victims of violent crime.” </p><p>Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, the committee chairman, noted that some Republican senators argued that Jackson was out of the mainstream when it comes to sentencing. Durbin asked the ABA whether such a concern would have surfaced in their interviews with the judges and lawyers who worked with her.</p><p>“It never came up in any of these interviews,” Williams said.</p><p>Joseph Drayton, another member of the ABA committee, said Jackson's reputation is “stellar.” </p><p>Democrats tried to portray Marshall himself as out of the mainstream, asking about his efforts to overturn Biden's 2020 presidential victory. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., asked Marshall whether Biden was the “duly elected” president. Marshall, who had supported a lawsuit to overturn Donald Trump’s defeat — would only say that Biden was president. The Supreme Court dismissed that suit. </p><p>The Senate committee is expected to vote on Jackson's nomination by April 4. Democrats are hoping to hold a final confirmation vote by Easter in mid-April, when the Senate leaves Washington for a two-week break. </p><p>GOP senators aggressively questioned Jackson on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ketanji-brown-jackson-notable-opinions-a764d001648c5151eb48e7f5663c403e">the sentences she has handed down</a> to child pornography offenders in her nine years as a federal judge, her legal advocacy on behalf of suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay, her thoughts on critical race theory and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-stephen-breyer-us-supreme-court-religion-judiciary-e87c64f1d5eb5cb61c8125df55ff8059">her religious views</a>. </p><p>The focus on sentencing was part of a larger effort by the committee's Republicans — several of whom are potential presidential candidates — to characterize Jackson's record, and her judicial philosophy, as too empathetic and soft on criminals who commit the worst offenses. It was also reflective of an emerging emphasis on crime in GOP midterm election campaigns.</p><p>Jackson said she bases sentences on many factors, not just federal guidelines. Sentencing is not a “numbers game,” she said, noting that there are no mandatory sentences for sex offenders and that there has been significant debate on the subject.</p><p>Some of the cases have given her nightmares, she said, and were “among the worst that I have seen.” </p><p>Durbin began Thursday’s hearing by thanking most Republicans on the committee, but he also said “some of the attacks on the judge were unfair, unrelenting and beneath the dignity of the United States Senate.”</p><p>Biden chose Jackson in February, fulfilling a campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. She would take the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, who announced in January that he would retire this summer after 28 years.</p><p>Jackson would be the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman. Her confirmation would maintain the current 6-3 conservative majority on the court. </p><p>She would also be the first former public defender on the court, and the first justice with experience representing indigent criminal defendants since Marshall. </p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Mark Sherman, Jessica Gresko, Lisa Mascaro, Darlene Superville and Colleen Long in Washington and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.</p></div>

From the beginning of the troop surge, Moscow denied any plans to attack Ukraine, calling such Western concerns part of a campaign to discredit Russia. At the same time, it urged the U.S. and its allies to keep Ukraine from joining NATO and roll back the alliance forces from Eastern Europe, demands the West rejected as nonstarters. </p><div id='afs:Card:709229193465' class='hub-peek-embed'>Hub peek embed (Russia-Ukraine) - Compressed layout (automatic embed) </div><div class="ad-placeholder" data='autoembed'></div><p>Then on Feb. 21, Putin abruptly upped the ante, recognizing the independence of pro-Russia rebel regions in eastern Ukraine.

Major international companies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-europe-economy-d205d9feeda7c4dc5a365d65375f8555">moved quickly to leave the Russian market</a>.</p><p>The severe measures — of a magnitude previously only levied against such countries as Iran and North Korea — sent the ruble into a nosedive, provoked a run on deposits and triggered consumer panic.</p><p>Russian authorities responded by introducing tight restrictions on hard-currency transactions and stock markets.</p><p>UKRAINE PLEADS FOR MORE WEAPONS, NO-FLY ZONE </p><p>While hailing Western sanctions and weapons supplies, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has challenged the U.S. and other Western allies to take even stronger measures to stop Russia.</p><p>He has continuously urged the U.S. and NATO to declare <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-antony-blinken-jens-stoltenberg-0ce4ac5076a0338facab78bf624a6d3b">a no-fly zone over Ukraine</a>, a demand the allies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskyy-technology-business-western-europe-feb816497f0f538b4b17ca7583cb072a">rejected for fear that it could result</a> in a direct confrontation with Russia and even spark a global conflict. </p><p>Zelenskyy also has pleaded with Western allies to provide Ukraine with warplanes and long-range air defense systems. Russia has sternly warned the West against such a move, and discussions on possible deliveries of Soviet-era fighter jets and air defense weapons from Eastern Europe to Ukraine have stalled as the West seeks <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-poland-united-states-europe-warsaw-534cd345f7bcb5a08a21fc2244efb04f"> to avoid a dangerous escalation</a>.</p><p>Ukraine has also asked the U.S. and the EU to ramp up sanctions to include <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-us-russia-oil-ban-120c0152cf310a5b593f6ae7a2857e62">a ban on Russian oil </a> and gas exports, a move opposed by many EU members that depend on Russia for a large share of their energy needs.</p><p>RUSSIAN OFFENSIVE BOGS DOWN</p><p>From the first days, the invasion hasn't gone the way Putin expected. After <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-what-to-know-1c7a5fc5e9cf84134592c855c363e791">quickly advancing to the outskirts of Kyiv </a> in the first days, Russian troops soon got bogged down in the suburbs. </p><p>Instead of surrendering, as the Kremlin hoped, Ukrainian troops fought back fiercely in every sector, thwarting Russian attempts to quickly roll into other large cities, including Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Russia also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-europe-nato-2d6348ea2fd973fa0c01e24acdff2908">failed to win full control of the skies over Ukraine</a> despite massive strikes targeting the country’s air force and air defense assets.</p><p>Russian military convoys have stretched for dozens of kilometers (miles) along a highway leading from Belarus, becoming an easy target for raids and ambushes. In the east, Russian troops have faced reinforced Ukrainian positions in the rebel regions and made only incremental gains. </p><p>Despite their hold on Mariupol and a quick capture of the ports of Berdyansk and Kherson, the Russians have failed to capture the key shipbuilding center of Mykolaiv and press the offensive farther west toward Odesa.</p><p>Western officials say Russian troops have been hampered by persistent supply shortages, struggling to get food and fuel and lacking proper cold weather gear.</p><p>In early March, the Russian military reported the loss of 498 soldiers, then never updated the toll again. In stark contrast, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-zelenskyy-kyiv-europe-nato-e35e54b40359e52f3ffd4911577b669a">NATO estimated on Wednesday</a> that 7,000 to 15,000 Russian troops were killed in four weeks. By way of comparison, the Soviet Union lost about 15,000 troops over a 10-year period during the war in Afghanistan. </p><p>NUCLEAR THREATS; CHEMICAL WEAPONS FEARS</p><p>The war raised concerns about the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.</p><p>On the first day of the invasion, Russian forces took control of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-chernobyl-russia-invasion-6f4b2da3c9623b7f1bf8f250a73a1bb5">decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear power plant</a>, site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster 36 years ago.

And on Wednesday, Russian military forces <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-tokyo-global-trade-world-war-ii-d970e7c51c2b6662b3ebe4531a96aa0f"> destroyed a new laboratory at Chernobyl</a>, according to the Ukrainian state agency responsible for the Chernobyl exclusion zone.</p><p>There also have been other fears over chemical leaks.</p><p>On March 21, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-zelenskyy-business-europe-73bb768354bf37b3768b29b946fe4314">an ammonia leak</a> at a chemical plant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy contaminated an area with a radius of more than 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) but didn’t hurt any civilians in the city of 263,000 because the wind didn’t blow in that direction.</p><p>The Russian military has repeatedly alleged that Ukrainian “nationalists” are hatching plans to blow up a nuclear or chemical facility and then blame it on the Russians — warnings that Western officials fear could herald such an attack from Russia. </p><p>Many in the West also fear that with the Russian offensive stalled, Putin could order the use of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-europe-jen-psaki-chemical-weapons-weapons-of-mass-destruction-f01cedf434ec697034b2912696a3448b">tactical nuclear weapons or chemical weapons</a> to spread fear and bring Ukraine to its knees.</p><p>WHAT'S NEXT </p><p>Even as his offensive stalls and the Russian economy shudders under Western sanctions, Putin shows no sign of backing down. </p><p>Despite the plummeting ruble and soaring consumer prices, Russian polls show robust support for Putin. Observers attribute those results to the Kremlin's massive propaganda campaign and crackdown on dissent.</p><p>Putin demands that Ukraine adopt a neutral status, drop its bid to join NATO, agree to demilitarize, recognize Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and acknowledge the independence of the rebel republics in the Donbas region.</p><p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-boris-johnson-business-europe-4b0fee549843a0a6ed73c314f8c2fa12">Zelenskyy said earlier this week</a> that Ukraine is ready to discuss a neutral status along with security guarantees that would preclude any further aggression. But he's said the status of Crimea and the separatist regions could be discussed only after a cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian troops.</p><p>Putin may be seeking to gain more ground and negotiate from a position of strength to force Zelenskyy into making concessions. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators say they are still far from drafting a prospective deal that Putin and Zelenskyy could discuss. </p></div>
