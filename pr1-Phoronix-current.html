The "birth time" file attribute with NFSv4 is for exposing the file creation time. This NFSD support will work atop modern Linux file-systems supporting the statx "btime" timestamp for exposing file creation time rather than only the time the file was last modified. <br /> <br />This has been made possible on Linux since a few years ago with the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.11-Statx-System-Call">statx system call</a> for being able to expose more file attributes. Most Linux file-systems these days can now support the file creation time attribute and has also been seeing support for making use of that extended metadata by Linux user-space. Now with Linux 5.18, NFSD will expose the NFSv4 "birth time" when on a supported file-system. <br /> <br />The Linux NFS client code has already supported making use of this NFSv4 attribute when exposed from the server. <br /> <br />In addition to the birth time file attribute, Linux 5.18 makes NFSD always build NFSv3 support unconditionally. Linux to this point has always made NFSv2 unconditional and then spinning NFSv3 out as a build option with <em>CONFIG_NFSD_V3</em>. But with plans to eventually deprecate NFSv2 and remove that code later, the developers are now making NFSv3 "always supported" to help in easing that eventual transition. <br /> <br />NFSD for Linux 5.18 also has some performance optimizations and other improvements. See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/EF97E1F5-B70F-4F9F-AC6D-7B48336AE3E5@oracle.com/">this pull request</a> for the details with these patches that have already landed into mainline.</div></div>

This work for allowing Tesla's full self-driving chip used in their latest electric vehicles. The Tesla FSD chip is loosely based on Samsung Exynos IP so there is some overlap there and Samsung engineers carried through to get this Tesla FSD support into the upstream Linux kernel. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=tesla_fsd_car" /><br /><em>There is now upstream support in the Linux kernel for the Tesla FSD chip.</em></p> <br />Not that most Tesla owners will be trying to load up a new Linux kernel or custom Linux distribution on their FSD system, this upstreaming in turn may lower the Tesla/Samsung maintenance burden moving forward with having less out-of-tree patches to carry for the kernel build in their software environment. The Tesla FSD SoC is made up of three clusters of four Cortex-A72 processor cores and several extra IP blocks. The Linux kernel support code for the Tesla FSD SoC at this stage is just under 4k lines of new code, on top of all the existing Samsung and AArch64 code within the mainline kernel. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=tesla_linux_518" /><br /><em>Tesla FSD SoC support in the mainline Linux kernel!</em></p> <br />The Tesla FSD chip support has been mainlined as of last night into the Linux 5.18 kernel with its merge window ongoing. The DeviceTree updates also include adding the Airoha EN7523 networking SoC, Mediatek MT6582 tablet platform, Microchip Lan966 networking SoC, Qualcomm Snapdragon 625/632 SoCs used by the LG Nexus 5X and Fairphone FP3, Renesas RZ/G2LC and RZ/V2L SoCs, and the Samsung Exynos 850 / 7885 SoCs. The <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=raspberrypi-zero-2w&num=1">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</a> is also now supported by the mainline Linux 5.18 kernel. The Rockchip Bananapi-R2-Pro is another Arm SBC added too. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=raspberrypi-zero-2w&image=raspberrypi_2w_4_med" /><br /><em>The Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W is also now supported by the mainline Linux kernel.</em></p> <br />Meanwhile the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=baaa68a9796ef2cadfe5caaf4c730412eda0f31c">Arm SoC patches</a> include support for the Cortex-M7 based i.MXRT10xx series, dropping NOMMU ARMv4/ARMv5 platforms, continuing to cleanup the Intel IXP4xx platform code, and other improvements. <br /> <br />Merged on Wednesday night were also the other Tesla FSD support drivers, memory controller updates for Tegra and Mediatek hardware, SCMI firmware interface updates, and improved power management for Mediate kMT81xx / NXP i.MXM8MQ / NVIDIA Tegra hardware.</div></div>

This new NVCODEC implementation works for both Windows and Linux using the proprietary driver's NVENC interface as with the NVIDIA Video Codec SDK that is part of CUDA. The GStreamer NVIDIA bits for both H.264 and H.265 are affected by this new implementation. The new implementation does drop the OpenGL path, RGBA support, and subsampled planar format support, but its new design does allow for better performance. <br /><p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=2022&image=nvidia_encode_gstreamer_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=nvidia_encode_gstreamer_med" /></a></p> <br />This new NVIDIA encoder implementation supports zero-copy memory handling for better performance.

Some of the Linux 5.18 networking highlights are below. <br /> <br />On the WiFi side there is now support for Mediatek MT7916 and MT7921U wireless hardware within the MT76 driver. The BRCMFMAC driver meanwhile has added support for Broadcom BCM43454/6 WiFi. The Intel IOSM driver has added support for the Intel M.2 7360 WWAN card. There is also a lot of new wired networking hardware support including for the Realtek RTL83675 and RTL8367RB-VB, Microchip KSZ8563 switches, Netronome NFP3800 SmartNICs, Fungible SmartNICs, and Mediatek MT8195 switches. <br /> <br />Some of the other driver work includes multi-buffer XDP handling in the Mellanox MLX5 driver, the Realtek R8169 driver will now enable ASPM L1.2 power savings if the system vendor flags it is safe, RJ45 ports handling in the Mellanox MLXSW driver, offloading work for the Marvell Presetera Ethernet driver code, various Intel WiFi (IWLWIFI) additions, background radar detection for the Mediatek MT76 driver,  the Realtek RTW89 driver adds AP mode support and 6GHz band coverage. <br /> <br />Most Linux kernel cycles also see new (e)BPF work and for Linux 5.18 that is the case. (e)BPF has added a packaging allocator for BPF JIT images and can lead to more efficient memory use, lower instruction TLB pressure, and other benefits. BPF also adds support for JIT'ing of add/and/or/xor/xchg atomic operations on AArch64.. There are also libbpf API improvements and a range of other enhancements. <br /> <br />There is also never-ending work on Linux network performance optimizations. For Linux 5.18 there are UDP IPv6 transfer optimizations, yielding up to a 5% improvement on a dummy net device. Additionally there are TSO packet size adjustments so very low latency links like those in data centers can always send full-sized TSO super-frames. Meanwhile the netns dismantling path is as much as five times faster while also having lower memory usage. Within the Intel Ethernet code is also improved AF_XDP performance. <br /> <br />See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220323180738.3978487-1-kuba@kernel.org/">this pull request</a> for the full assortment of networking updates for Linux 5.18.</div></div>

This IGC ray-tracing support appears to be mostly for their Windows driver stack which uses IGC for shader compilation. On the Linux driver side, IGC is currently just used by their Compute-Runtime compute stack for OpenCL and Level Zero. Intel though has said they are looking at using IGC within Mesa in the future, at which point this ray-tracing support will be of use there. <br /> <br />On the Linux graphics side within Mesa, as covered across numerous Phoronix articles Intel's Mesa developers have already been working on the NIR compiler support, the Intel ANV Vulkan driver ray-tracing extension support, and related plumbing for supporting Vulkan ray-tracing with the forthcoming GPUs. Intel also just recently <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Intel-OpenCL-CLC-Mesa-22.1">added a tiny OpenCL compiler to Mesa</a> as they will be using OpenCL code for building acceleration structures for their Vulkan ray-tracing implementation. <br /> <br />Anyhow, back to IGC 1.0.10713, there is the initial ray-tracing compiler work in this release along with various vector back-end improvements, more OpenCL built-in extensions being supported, support for more SPIR-V functions, and a variety of other compiler additions for this LLVM-based Intel graphics compiler stack. <br /> <br />More details on the v1.0.10713 update via <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/releases/tag/igc-1.0.10713">GitHub</a>.</div></div>

But now with Linux 5.18 the AndesCore NDS32 architecture is being removed over lack of active maintenance. <br /> <br />The NDS32 Linux kernel port has been for supporting older Andes Technology N13 / N15 / D15 / N10 / D10 era processor cores. These processor cores use a 16/32-bit AndeStar RISC-like architecture. This architecture is designed to be performance-efficient with a small footprint for embedded use-cases from IoT to digital signal controls and various other use-cases. <br /> <br />While AndesCore NDS32 processors are still used in the world today, the lack of active upstream maintenance on the CPU architecture port is leading to its removal. The <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAK8P3a0DeZ4Gx6fOqLkjmA7kNYW5ZHq8BUpWTXXdqdtxcHRNLg@mail.gmail.com/">asm-generic pull request</a> for Linux 5.18 drops NDS32. Arnd Bermann sums up the situation as, "<em>The nds32 architecture ends its tenure in the Linux kernel. The hardware is still used and the code is in reasonable shape, but the mainline port is not actively maintained any more, as all remaining users are thought to run vendor kernels that would never be updated to a future release.</em>" <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=andes_n10" /><br /><em>Andes N10 is one of the CPU designs affected by the NDS32 removal.</em></p> <br />Further eroding the viability of this port is newer AndesCore processors are 32-bit and 64-bit designs based on RISC-V. Andes Tech's AndesStar V5 ISA is based on RISC-V now and that is the company's path ahead and thus not incentivized to continue maintaining this NDS32 code for their older processors. <br /> <br />Given AndeStar V3 era hardware only appeared in deeply embedded systems, it's unlikely any of you are running NDS32 especially with modern kernels. Out-of-tree kernel ports such as with Andes Tech's SDK still exist as does the NDS32 support still being found in existing Linux LTS kernel series.</div></div>

There has been some disagreeing with my assessment that AMD Zen 4 will still be Family 19h, but the patch work continues to be pointing to that being the case. Zen 4 looks like it will be in Family 19h -- the same as Zen 3 -- and similar to how Zen / Zen+ / Zen 2 spanned Family 17h.  <br />  <br />While these patches do not spell out Zen 4, these model IDs don't match existing AMD CPUs including the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=30985">newly released and exciting Milan-X parts</a>. The AMD EDAC changes for Linux 5.18 add the ability to set the memory type per DIMM -- not for say DDR5 and DDR4, but the likes of LRDDR5 / DDR5 / RDDR5 memory types across different memory controllers. The other work is setting a new "family flags" bitmask and using new offsets for AMD Family 19h Model 10h. A new bitfield is added for indicating DDR5 memory use on a memory controller.  <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=linux_518_edac" /><br /><em>The Linux kernel continues preparing AMD code paths around DDR5 support for next-generation platforms.</em></p>  <br />Besides the EDAC work, there has been thermal monitoring and other additions in recent and ongoing kernels ahead of AMD's next-gen hardware launches. See the <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/YjhQYeGqsuiXAsSp@zn.tnic/">EDAC pull request</a> for more details on the changes that were merged on the Error Detection and Correction front for Linux 5.18.</div></div>

	<time datetime="2022-03-23 17:00:00">2022-03-23 17:00:00</time>
	
	<div class="content"><div class="content">   <p>Last Friday the crew at Asahi Linux led by Hector Martin released <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Asahi-Linux-Apple-M1-Alpha">the first alpha release for running Linux on Apple Silicon hardware</a>. I eagerly loaded up Asahi Linux on an M1-powered Apple Mac Mini knowing the various early limitations of the Linux kernel support that is still settling. Overall the Apple M1 Linux performance ended up exceeding my expectations for the performance in its early alpha state. Here are some benchmarks.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_1_med" /></a><br /><em>Linux running bare metal on an Apple M1 Mac Mini!</em></p>  <p>The Asahi Linux alpha release allows those with Apple M1 hardware (except for the recent Mac Studio support still being worked on) to run an Arch Linux based distribution on the hardware natviely. The Asahi Linux installer is triggered from within macOS 12.3+ via a script in the Terminal.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_2_med" /></a></p>  <p>The Asahi Linux install script allowed for successfully setting up the Linux environment on the Mac Mini while preserving the dual boot support to macOS 12. It worked well and was almost entirely automated except for needing confirmation of actions, etc.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_3_med" /></a><br /><em>Not the most helpful error message for indicating not enough disk space...</em></p>  <p>One initial issue encountered was I had over-estimated the amount of free space on the Mac Mini... The  Asahi Linux installer didn't provide a useful end-user message with that case over lack of storage. But when hitting the Python error and thinking through the possibilities, I realized the lack of storage space was likely the issue. Indeed after wiping away excess files, the Asahi Linux installer proceeded without issues.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_4_med" /></a></p>  <p>The Asahi Linux install experience was quick and easy on this 2020 Mac Mini. There are various known limitations right now of Asahi Linux and the upstream Linux kernel support, such as around the speaker handling, flaky headphone jack, and other features on MacBook. Most notable though is the lack of any 3D/graphics acceleration right now for the Apple M1 GPU. That is being worked on by Alyssa and others but still will likely be some time before their OpenGL Gallium3D driver is squared away as well as mainlining of their DRM kernel driver. Plus there will be the need for a Vulkan driver too after that. So for those depending upon graphics acceleration, this is a major blocker at the moment if wanting to use Asahi Linux as your daily driver but is being worked on the community crew. LLVMpipe though with KDE Plasma did work out fairly robust on the Mac Mini.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_6_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_6_med" /></a><br /><em>The M1 Mac Mini used for this macOS/Linux Apple Silicon benchmarking.</em></p>  <p>Besides the lack of GPU acceleration, another notable area still being worked on is around the M1 power management and performance state handling, including not yet having any CPU boost states working. Some users have also reported their M1 MacBooks running rather warm under Asahi Linux, but that is less of a concern for the Mac Mini or with regard to battery life. In any even with the known limitations for this early alpha release, I was still rather impressed by the M1 Linux performance at this stage.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_7_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=apple-m1-linux-perf&image=m1_linux_7_med" /></a></p>  </div></div>
