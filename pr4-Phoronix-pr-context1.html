On the new drivers side, there is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.18-HID-SigmaMicro">the HID SigmaMicro driver</a> for keyboards using SiGma Micro keyboard control ICs. At this stage the driver is primarily about these ICs in some keyboards leading to mapping all modifier keys as L-Shift input while this new driver corrects that behavior. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=0x2011&image=razer_bw_keyboard3_med" /><br /><em>Razer BlackWidow Keyboard</em></p> <br />The other prominent new driver is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Razer-HID-For-Linux-5.18">a Razer HID driver</a> initially focused on the Razer BlackWindow keyboards that aren't fully in compliant with the HID specification. Using this new driver will fix the macro key handling for the BlackWidow keyboards. Moving forward, hid-razer may be extended to deal with quirks / incompliant specs with other Razer hardware. <br /> <br />The HID pull for Linux 5.18 also has the start of work for working to "vastly improve Linux support for tablets", reworking of generic input handling that can lead to processing of tablet events in a more generic and reliable manner, and various other driver fixes. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=apple_keyboard_linux518_med" /><br /><em>There are many Apple keyboard improvements coming with Linux 5.18 both for the Magic Keyboard (pictured) and the keyboards with their MacBooks.</em></p> <br />Meanwhile on the Apple side there are many fixes and improved hardware support with Linux 5.18. Among the Apple HID changes are: <br /> <br />- Correct function key (Fn) mapping for first-generation Apple Magic Keyboards for 2007~2009 models and the 2011 alunimum wireless model. The default Fn key mapping was used up to this point while now there is a dedicated one for these first-generation keyboards to address issues around emitting backlight events when the keyboards do not have a backlight and the inability to this point for being able to set the numlock status without having another keyboard connected to the system. <br /> <br />- There is also now a proper Fn key mapping for the Apple Magic Keyboard 2015 model, which also addresses the matter of the keyboard to now emitting keyboard backlight up/down events even with not having a backlight. <br /> <br />- Support with the Magic Keyboard 2021 model to be able to report the battery level when connected via USB. The battery level reporting already worked when connected via Bluetooth. <br /> <br />- Another commit also gets the fingerprint reader battery reporting to work over USB for the Magic Keyboard 2021 model. <br /> <br />- Support for the keyboard backlight control on various Apple T2-chipped Macs. There are also various IDs added for handling the keyboard with other Macs relying on the T2 security chip. <br /> <br />- Fn key mapping support for MacBook Pros that have a Touch Bar.  <br /> <br />See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/nycvar.YFH.7.76.2203231015060.24795@cbobk.fhfr.pm/">this pull request</a> for the full list of HID patches for the Linux 5.18 merge window.</div></div>

	<time datetime="2022-03-24 23:42:42">2022-03-24 23:42:42</time>
	
	<div class="content"><div class="content"> <div style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px;"><img alt="VALVE -- " src="assets/categories/valve.jpg" width="100" height="100" /></div> Valve's Gamescope Wayland compositor is what was born out of their former Steamcompmgr effort but rewritten to target Wayland, interfacing directly with DRM/KMS APIs for enhanced efficiency, and making use of Vulkan. To date Gamescope has worked with the Intel and Radeon open-source Linux graphics driver stacks while the NVIDIA proprietary driver is seeing work in the direction of supporting it. <br /> <br />Besides Gamescope being interesting for its performance / latency benefits as part of its design to optimize for running games, it also provides features like integrated FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and integer scaling too. Due to its growing popularity among gamers and tangible benefits, NVIDIA is working to support Gamescope with their driver. <br /> <br />NVIDIA has confirmed they are working on Gamescope support for their driver and this week NVIDIA's James Jones  sent out an initial pull request of fixes for handling the NVIDIA driver usage. The changes to Gamescope requested are for raising the soft file descriptor (FD) limit for the process at start-up and not using the GAMMA_LUT CRTC property where not supported. These generic changes in turn are a step towards NVIDIA driver compatibility. <br /> <br />The <a href="https://github.com/Plagman/gamescope/pull/454">initial pull request</a> so far seems like the changes should end up landing though further improvements to Gamescope may be made still. This though is just the initial step for making NVIDIA and the Gamescope compositor happy. But "soon" they are hoping to have everything ironed out for NVIDIA Linux gamers wanting to run Gamescope with their (X)Wayland games.</div></div>

	<h2><a class="itemtitle" href="https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=31007">Windows vs. Linux Benchmarks For AMD Ryzen Server Performance</a></h2>
	<time datetime="2022-03-24 19:00:00">2022-03-24 19:00:00</time>
	
	<div class="content"><div class="content">   <p>As a follow-up to last week's article looking at how <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/vr.php?view=30980">AMD is making an interesting case for budget-friendly Ryzen dedicated servers</a> and not only in Europe but throughout the world more hosting providers are offering cost-conscious AMD Ryzen powered dedicated server options, here is a look at how various Linux distributions run on an ASRock Rack based AMD Ryzen server up against Microsoft Windows.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=ryzen-server-os&image=ryzen_server_os1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=ryzen-server-os&image=ryzen_server_os1_med" /></a></p>  <p>While having the ASRock Rack 1U4LW-X570/2L2T barebones server platform in the lab, I ran a number of benchmarks across different Linux distributions plus Windows to see how these operating systems competed and also to verify all of the OSes under test were behaving fine on the AMD Ryzen server. There were no compatibility issues to note with any of the tested software platforms - all was good there. However, that really wasn't surprising given the age of the AMD X570 chipset and having found the AMD Ryzen 5000 series working well on Linux going back to launch-day.</p>  <p>The ASRock Rack 1U4LW-X570/2L2T server that was provided to me by AMD was this 1U server platform loaded up with an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 4 x 32GB ECC DDR4-3200 memory, and a 960GB P80 3TE6 NVMe solid-state drive. The operating systems I tested with this Ryzen 1U server included:</p>  <p>- AlmaLinux 8.5<br />  - CentOS Stream 9<br />  - Clear Linux 35810<br />  - Fedora Server 35<br />  - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS<br />  - Ubuntu 22.04 development snapshot<br />  - openSUSE Leap 15.3<br />  - Windows 11 Pro</p>  <p>All operating systems had all their latest stable release updates as of when the testing happened in February. All of the operating systems were tested with clean installs on this same ASRock Rack Ryzen server in their out-of-the-box configuration. Worth mentioning with the Linux distribution list is <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AMD-Joins-AlmaLinux">AMD recently began backing AlmaLinux</a> for those looking at a CentOS 8 alternative.</p>  <p align="center"><a href="//www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=ryzen-server-os&image=ryzen_server_os2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=ryzen-server-os&image=ryzen_server_os2_med" /></a></p>  <p>As for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro being used on this Ryzen "server" rather than Windows Server, that is the configuration commonly used by data centers offering Ryzen dedicated servers. With dedicated hosting providers offering Ryzen for its cost effectiveness and lower-tiered options compared to EPYC, they tend to be using Windows 10 or Windows 11 with the Ryzen processors to reduce license costs. Additionally, many of those getting Windows on Ryzen servers are for running Windows game servers or the like. Ryzen servers with Windows also appear popular for creative workloads like renderers and other asset creation tasks, which in turn is a dominant focus with today's benchmarks.</p>  <div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto;"><object data="//openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2202151-NE-2202134NE49&sha=e421675ec729&p=2" type="image/svg+xml"></object></div>  <p>So for those curious about the Ryzen Windows vs. Linux performance, here is some fresh data.</p>  </div><div class="content">   <div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto;"><object data="//openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2202151-NE-2202134NE49&sha=26c85ac03370&p=2" type="image/svg+xml"></object></div>  <div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto;"><object data="//openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2202151-NE-2202134NE49&sha=2c896fff142d&p=2" type="image/svg+xml"></object></div>  <div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto;"><object data="//openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2202151-NE-2202134NE49&sha=19a2f5d1dd59&p=2" type="image/svg+xml"></object></div>  <p>One of the areas where AMD Ryzen dedicated servers can make a big impact is for budget render boxes for 3D rendering with the likes of Blender. Thanks to Ryzen 9 CPUs going up to 16 cores / 32 threads, it's double the core/thread count as the Xeon E-2300 series currently offers (8 cores / 16 threads tops). As shown in last week's article looking at the Xeon E vs. Ryzen performance, the highly threaded renderers were running great on AMD. Now with these benchmarks today and jiving with our past benchmark comparisons, Blender CPU rendering performance is the better on Linux than Windows. This ASRock Rack server saw much better performance with the tested Linux builds than under Windows 11 Pro.</p>  <div style="text-align: center; overflow: auto;"><object data="//openbenchmarking.org/embed.php?i=2202151-NE-2202134NE49&sha=235b8b6043fc&p=2" type="image/svg+xml"></object></div>  <div style="text-align: center;

The "birth time" file attribute with NFSv4 is for exposing the file creation time. This NFSD support will work atop modern Linux file-systems supporting the statx "btime" timestamp for exposing file creation time rather than only the time the file was last modified. <br /> <br />This has been made possible on Linux since a few years ago with the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-4.11-Statx-System-Call">statx system call</a> for being able to expose more file attributes. Most Linux file-systems these days can now support the file creation time attribute and has also been seeing support for making use of that extended metadata by Linux user-space. Now with Linux 5.18, NFSD will expose the NFSv4 "birth time" when on a supported file-system. <br /> <br />The Linux NFS client code has already supported making use of this NFSv4 attribute when exposed from the server. <br /> <br />In addition to the birth time file attribute, Linux 5.18 makes NFSD always build NFSv3 support unconditionally. Linux to this point has always made NFSv2 unconditional and then spinning NFSv3 out as a build option with <em>CONFIG_NFSD_V3</em>. But with plans to eventually deprecate NFSv2 and remove that code later, the developers are now making NFSv3 "always supported" to help in easing that eventual transition. <br /> <br />NFSD for Linux 5.18 also has some performance optimizations and other improvements. See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/EF97E1F5-B70F-4F9F-AC6D-7B48336AE3E5@oracle.com/">this pull request</a> for the details with these patches that have already landed into mainline.</div></div>

This work for allowing Tesla's full self-driving chip used in their latest electric vehicles. The Tesla FSD chip is loosely based on Samsung Exynos IP so there is some overlap there and Samsung engineers carried through to get this Tesla FSD support into the upstream Linux kernel. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=tesla_fsd_car" /><br /><em>There is now upstream support in the Linux kernel for the Tesla FSD chip.</em></p> <br />Not that most Tesla owners will be trying to load up a new Linux kernel or custom Linux distribution on their FSD system, this upstreaming in turn may lower the Tesla/Samsung maintenance burden moving forward with having less out-of-tree patches to carry for the kernel build in their software environment. The Tesla FSD SoC is made up of three clusters of four Cortex-A72 processor cores and several extra IP blocks. The Linux kernel support code for the Tesla FSD SoC at this stage is just under 4k lines of new code, on top of all the existing Samsung and AArch64 code within the mainline kernel. <br /><p align="center"><img src="//www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2022&image=tesla_linux_518" /><br /><em>Tesla FSD SoC support in the mainline Linux kernel!</em></p> <br />The Tesla FSD chip support has been mainlined as of last night into the Linux 5.18 kernel with its merge window ongoing. The DeviceTree updates also include adding the Airoha EN7523 networking SoC, Mediatek MT6582 tablet platform, Microchip Lan966 networking SoC, Qualcomm Snapdragon 625/632 SoCs used by the LG Nexus 5X and Fairphone FP3, Renesas RZ/G2LC and RZ/V2L SoCs, and the Samsung Exynos 850 / 7885 SoCs. The <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=raspberrypi-zero-2w&num=1">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</a> is also now supported by the mainline Linux 5.18 kernel.

Some of the Linux 5.18 networking highlights are below. <br /> <br />On the WiFi side there is now support for Mediatek MT7916 and MT7921U wireless hardware within the MT76 driver. The BRCMFMAC driver meanwhile has added support for Broadcom BCM43454/6 WiFi. The Intel IOSM driver has added support for the Intel M.2 7360 WWAN card. There is also a lot of new wired networking hardware support including for the Realtek RTL83675 and RTL8367RB-VB, Microchip KSZ8563 switches, Netronome NFP3800 SmartNICs, Fungible SmartNICs, and Mediatek MT8195 switches. <br /> <br />Some of the other driver work includes multi-buffer XDP handling in the Mellanox MLX5 driver, the Realtek R8169 driver will now enable ASPM L1.2 power savings if the system vendor flags it is safe, RJ45 ports handling in the Mellanox MLXSW driver, offloading work for the Marvell Presetera Ethernet driver code, various Intel WiFi (IWLWIFI) additions, background radar detection for the Mediatek MT76 driver,  the Realtek RTW89 driver adds AP mode support and 6GHz band coverage. <br /> <br />Most Linux kernel cycles also see new (e)BPF work and for Linux 5.18 that is the case. (e)BPF has added a packaging allocator for BPF JIT images and can lead to more efficient memory use, lower instruction TLB pressure, and other benefits. BPF also adds support for JIT'ing of add/and/or/xor/xchg atomic operations on AArch64.. There are also libbpf API improvements and a range of other enhancements. <br /> <br />There is also never-ending work on Linux network performance optimizations. For Linux 5.18 there are UDP IPv6 transfer optimizations, yielding up to a 5% improvement on a dummy net device. Additionally there are TSO packet size adjustments so very low latency links like those in data centers can always send full-sized TSO super-frames. Meanwhile the netns dismantling path is as much as five times faster while also having lower memory usage. Within the Intel Ethernet code is also improved AF_XDP performance. <br /> <br />See <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220323180738.3978487-1-kuba@kernel.org/">this pull request</a> for the full assortment of networking updates for Linux 5.18.</div></div>

This IGC ray-tracing support appears to be mostly for their Windows driver stack which uses IGC for shader compilation. On the Linux driver side, IGC is currently just used by their Compute-Runtime compute stack for OpenCL and Level Zero. Intel though has said they are looking at using IGC within Mesa in the future, at which point this ray-tracing support will be of use there. <br /> <br />On the Linux graphics side within Mesa, as covered across numerous Phoronix articles Intel's Mesa developers have already been working on the NIR compiler support, the Intel ANV Vulkan driver ray-tracing extension support, and related plumbing for supporting Vulkan ray-tracing with the forthcoming GPUs. Intel also just recently <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Intel-OpenCL-CLC-Mesa-22.1">added a tiny OpenCL compiler to Mesa</a> as they will be using OpenCL code for building acceleration structures for their Vulkan ray-tracing implementation. <br /> <br />Anyhow, back to IGC 1.0.10713, there is the initial ray-tracing compiler work in this release along with various vector back-end improvements, more OpenCL built-in extensions being supported, support for more SPIR-V functions, and a variety of other compiler additions for this LLVM-based Intel graphics compiler stack. <br /> <br />More details on the v1.0.10713 update via <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/releases/tag/igc-1.0.10713">GitHub</a>.</div></div>
